## 📐 Key Metrics & DAX Measures

### Core KPIs

#### 1. **Total Orders**
```dax
Total Orders = COUNTROWS(Orders)
```

#### 2. **On-Time Delivery Rate**
```dax
On Time Delivery % = 
DIVIDE(
    CALCULATE(
        COUNTROWS(Orders),
        Orders[Is Delayed] = FALSE
    ),
    COUNTROWS(Orders),
    0
) * 100
```

#### 3. **Customer Satisfaction Score**
```dax
CSAT % = 
AVERAGE(Orders[Customer Satisfaction Score]) * 100
```

#### 4. **Average Delivery Time**
```dax
Avg Delivery Time = 
AVERAGE(Orders[Delivery Time Hours])
```

### Time Intelligence Measures

#### Previous Month Comparison
```dax
PM Total Orders = 
CALCULATE(
    [Total Orders],
    PREVIOUSMONTH('Date Table'[Date])
)

Orders Variance from PM = 
DIVIDE(
    [Total Orders] - [PM Total Orders],
    [PM Total Orders],
    0
) * 100
```

### Advanced Analytics Measures

#### Driver Delay Percentage
```dax
Driver Delay % = 
DIVIDE(
    CALCULATE(
        COUNTROWS(Orders),
        Orders[Is Delayed] = TRUE
    ),
    COUNTROWS(Orders),
    0
) * 100
```

#### Hub Capacity Utilization
```dax
Hub Utilization % = 
DIVIDE(
    [Total Orders],
    MAX(Hubs[Hub Capacity]),
    0
) * 100
```

#### Fleet Active Count
```dax
Active Vehicles = 
CALCULATE(
    COUNTROWS(Vehicles),
    Vehicles[Breakdown] = "Active"
)
```
